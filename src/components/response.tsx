          <li>Identity disturbance (unstable self-image or sense of self).</li>
          <li>
            Impulsivity in at least two potentially self-damaging areas (e.g.,
            spending, substance use, reckless driving, binge eating).
          </li>
          <li>
            Recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, or threats, or
            self-mutilating behavior.
          </li>
          <li>
            Affective instability due to marked reactivity of mood. Chronic
            feelings of emptiness.

          <li>Inappropriate, intense anger or difficulty controlling anger.</li>
          <li>
